      <p>
        At the moment, there is no monetization in place for the SubAccounts
        project, so we heavily rely on the support of sponsors to keep the
        development going. If you believe in our vision and want to help us
        grow, you can contribute by sending funds to the following address:{" "}
        <b
          dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
            __html: addHTMLBreaksToAddress(siteConfig.links.support),
          }}
        />
        . Every contribution is highly appreciated and directly supports the
        development and maintenance of the project.
      </p>
      <h2 className={title({ size: "md" })}>How to support</h2>
